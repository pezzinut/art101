            <h2> Challenges</h2>
            <p> Within the beginning of the lab, my partner and I hadn't bumped into any problems. Writing down the function was overall a straightforward process.
                However, the part where I was stuck on was having the script output show on my default browser.
            </p>
            <h2> Problems </h2>
            <p> My partner and I had compared our code and file structures and are still unsure what is the leading cause to the output not
                showcasing locally. After some debugging, I was able to figure out the cause and quickly have it back running.</p>
