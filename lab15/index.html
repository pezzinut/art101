					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p> For this lab, my partner and I looked through our past labs, analzying the Javascript of each lab, looking for any potential overlooeked errors to debug.</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
                    <p> Surprisingly, the issue for this lab wasn't the fact that it was diffucult, but rather, there was no issues to debug. With the past labs, my partner and I put alot of emphasis in debugging the code until it matched what each lab had asked for. Therefore, all of the debugging had previously been done. So instead, my partner and I focused more on the bonus Task. </p>
