            <p>This lab was by far the hardest out of them all. With this lab specifically, it was more of a "heres some examples, now you are on your own", rather than given a guide. However, with a bunch of debugging and help from my partner, we were able to push through and complete it. I had issues with two buttons showing up instead of one button. On top of that, the toggle button wouldn't toggle an alternate display as it should've.</p>
