					<h2>PROBLEMS</h2>
                    <p>My partner and I ran into issues within the console, as we both had tried opening the map, but we realized the issue was that we had named our array two different names, and from there on we were able to resolve the issue. Other than that, this lab was pretty smooth and straiht forward</p>
