					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Within this lab, there wasn't any signifcant probelms that I had faced. Even though I had missed the lecture which covered the conttent for this lab (sick) I was able to review the lecture slides in order to grasp a pretty good understanding of the content. Therefore, this lab was easier then I had expected. </p>
